<h1>Blueprint for a Sustainable Campus</h1>
<p> The Blueprint for a Sustainable Campus is a multi-use, living document that strives to encompass the current visions of students, faculty, staff, and community members that have come together to share their ideas and goals for the future of UCSC at the annual Campus Earth Summit event. This document is meant to serve as a launching point for students to create meaningful, collaborative projects on campus that inspire lasting change. The Blueprint also acts as a guide for student organizations interested in receiving funding from the Campus Sustainability Council for the upcoming school year. While the Blueprint reflects no commitments from the administration, the process through which it is compiled displays multiple points of collaboration throughout the campus and community. </p>
